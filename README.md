# Genetic-Algorithms
This repository has different genetic alogrithms one in each folder. It includes: 
1) Simplest "One max" task on generic python;
2) "One max" task using "Deep" library;
3) Sea battle algorithm that shows better ships placement;
4) Graphs alrogithm that used to find minimus path from one vertex to others;
5) Function minimum find minimum of Himmelblau function using genetic algorithms;
6) Maze, Maze_wall_like, Maze_step_by_step using genetic algorithms to find minimum path between two spots at the field with diffrent metods and diffrent configuration for each folder.
